        <h1>Projects</h1>
        <h2>Bloomberg for the masses</h2>
        <h4>TL;DR</h4>
        <p>
          Built an investment insight-driven product to bridge the gap between frictionless investing apps 
          such as Robinhood and the often limited investing knowledge of their users. Utilized input from 
          potential users, industry veterans and A/B testing to build an MVP centered around an investment 
          insights feed. I ultimately deprecated this project due to a lack of clarity around monetization potential.
        </p>

        <h4>Personal Objective: </h4>
        <p>
          I undertook this project to help bolster my product acumen by taking a product from 0 to 1. 
          Managing a small startup team and learning through trial and error were instrumental to 
          building my understanding of what it takes to run a concept all the way from ideation
          to a functioning software product that brings real value to users.
        </p>

        <p> 
        <h4>Problem: </h4>
        <p>
          Robinhood brought in a new cohort of investors through its frictionless trading app. 
          However, there was a clear disconnect between the newfound ease of trading and knowledge level 
          needed for these users to invest responsibly
        </p>
        <h4>Solution: </h4>
        <p>
          Using the ease of use and clean processed data found in the Bloomberg Terminal as inspiration,
          I set out to develop an app that would bridge the disconnect described above by providing users
          with relevant investment insights that would improve their ability to invest. Based on early
          user input, research and given the realtime nature of markets and investing in general, 
          I determined that the app should revolve around a central feed that would be consistently updated 
          with the most relevant insights at the top.
        </p>

        <h4>Process: </h4>
        <p>
          I identified and extensively interviewed about 50 individuals with a variety of investment 
          knowledge levels and portfolio sizes. These interviews helped me identify 3 key user segments:
        </p>
        <p>
          1) Complete neophyte investors (have made a total of less than 5 trades)
        </p>
        <p>
          2) Investors (typically make investments every month)
        </p>
        <p>
          3) Regular traders (typically make investments every week and may trade options)
        </p>
        <p>
          I also brought in key advisors that had either built institutional-grade investment tools or 
          worked for established brokerages to provide us with related know-how.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the app build, we vetted and hired two engineers in Ukraine that specialized in React Native.
          The build was broken up into 3 key milestones with approximately 2 weeks allotted for each. 
          At the same time I worked with a designer in San Francisco to map out and hone the app UX in Figma. 
          Prototype mock-ups were regularly shown to our user group in order to solicit constant feedback
          to help determine development direction. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The market segment I ultimately decided to pursue was between 2) Investors and 3) Regular traders
          as these users were already more engaged, had typically moved beyond the investing basics and
          were mainly seeking some level of direction in making their investments.
        </p>
        <h4>Outcome: </h4>
        <p>
          We were accepted into Boston-based Fintech Sandbox, which gave us the ability to utilize expensive
          institutional-grade market data feeds for free while in development, and completed app development. 
        </p>
        <p>
          However, ultimately there was a disconnect between the underserved needs (investment insights)
          and the value proposition presented. It turned out that potential customers would pay for an app that 
          outright told them what financial instruments to buy or sell rather than one that would improve 
          their existing decision-making process. Going in this direction would get into sticky regulatory 
          issues around financial recommendations as well as potential for making poor calls due to a myriad 
          of reasons (macro environment shifts, surprise announcements, etc.) A clear path to monetization 
          was just not there despite the perceived product market fit. 
        </p>
        <h4>Post-Mortem: </h4>
        <p>
          If I did this project again, I would:
        </p>
        <p>
          A) Hold off on building until there was an ironclad monetization strategy in place that had 
          been properly vetted by end-user research.
        </p>
        <p>
          B) Investigate potentially using smaller but more lucrative cohorts of customers (i.e. 
          professional traders, family offices, etc.) as an early adopter beachhead from which to build 
          off of.
