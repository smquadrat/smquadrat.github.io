        <h2>Debit card point API for financial institutions</h2>
        <h4>TL;DR</h4>
        <p>
          Built an API that would give point collecting capabilities to debit cards issued by small to mid-sized
          financial institutions (i.e. credit unions and regional banks). Even though there was strong interest
          from two potential MVP candidates, the technical complexities around integrating with antiquated on-prem systems
          proved too great and I didn't pursue this project to the implementation phase.
        </p>

        <h4>Personal Objective: </h4>
        <p>
          I undertook this project to learn about what it takes to build, sell and ultimately integrate B2B enterprise
          software for financial institutions. I spent a fair portion of my career analyzing and working within 
          major banks so was already somewhat familiar with the regulatory and technical complexities associated with selling
          software to them. However, actually doing so would teach me a great deal about just how onerous and challenging
          this process was for all stakeholders involved.
        </p>

        <p> 
        <h4>Problem: </h4>
        <p>
          Chase, Citi and Amex are the top 3 largest card issuers in the U.S. by market share. All three place
          strong emphasis on their point card offerings, which they use to lock customers into their respective 
          financial ecosystems. Chase and Citi, which are key parts of massive multinational financial service conglomerates, 
          are able to upsell their customers to high value products such as home mortgages. Although most small to mid-sized 
          financial institutions issue their own debit cards, the majority don't bother with point systems due to the complexity 
          and resources involved with building such products internally. As a result, they lose a potentially strong
          ecosystem enhancer that could better lock-in customers and make it easier to upsell their customers to high value 
          products such as home mortgage loans down the line.
        </p>
        <h4>Solution: </h4>
        <p>
          An API would enable financial institutions to add point capabilities to their existing debit card products. 
          Such a product would ingest transaction data via the Visa and Mastercard APIs and integrate with existing
          financial institution systems (on-prem or cloud-based architecture).
        </p>

        <h4>Process: </h4>
        <p>
          I started off by speaking to numerous individuals that had worked for the credit card divisions of major banks
          in order to assess how internal systems were structured and what growth strategies were employed to build point
          programs over time. One interesting takeaway from these conversations was that even in recent years there has been
          little effort made to build a concerted strategy around actively upselling credit card customers to higher value 
          products based on actual card activity. This was in large part due to relatively limited collaboration between the 
          teams in massive organizations that could enable this.  
        </p>
        <p>
          I worked with an engineer to map out the API and identify how it would ingest data from debit cards via Visa
          and Mastercard APIs, tag relevant customer transactions with points from participating retailers (i.e. Starbucks, etc.) 
          and interface with bank systems. APIs were scoped for both banks that still maintained on-prem systems and those which 
          have migrated to cloud systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was able to get in front of decision makers within two regional banks in order to assess product-market fit 
          and determine how to best integrate an MVP with bank systems. I also spoke with B2B startup founders that had
          successfully sold their software products to banks in order to map out a more effective path forward. Though 
          these conversations were illuminating, the subsequent technical challenges of how to successfully integrate the 
          API with bank systems became readily clear (i.e. COBOL code running on IBM mainframes).
        </p>

        <h4>Outcome: </h4>
        <p>
          Judging from my conversations with bank software decision makers, there appeared to be a strong
          product-market fit for the API. However, given the onerous technical complexities involved with actually 
          integrating the API with the on-prem systems of the banks targeted for testing the MVP, I decided 
          to deprecate the project. Most financial institutions that still utilize on-prem architecture have some plan to 
          migrate to the cloud in the future and going forward with a 3-4 year build cycle only to release a redundant product
          seemed too large of a risk to take.
        </p>

        <h4>Post-Mortem: </h4>
        <p>
          If I did this project again, I would:
        </p>
        <p>
          A) Look to embed our engineering efforts with a bank partner from Day 1 to get a proof of concept up and running
          as soon as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          B) Once the MVP was up and running with the first customer, I would look to identify common 
          build components and those that needed to be customized for each customer financial institution 
          in order to develop efficient sales and integration roadmaps that could be used for winning over subsequent 
          customers. I would also group financial institutions by internal software architectures in order to 
          identify and specifically target the most promising early customers.
