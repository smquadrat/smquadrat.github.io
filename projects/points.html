        <h2>Debit cards points API for financial institutions</h2>
        <h4>TL;DR</h4>
        <p>
          Built an API that would give points collecting capabilities to debit cards issued by small to mid-sized
          financial institutions (i.e. credit unions and regional banks). Even though there was strong interest
          from two potential MVP candidates, the technical complexities of integrating with antiquated on-prem systems
          proved too great and I didn't pursue the project to the implementation phase.
        </p>

        <h4>Personal Objective: </h4>
        <p>
          I undertook this project to learn about what it took to build, sell and ultimately integrate enterprise
          software for financial institutions. I spent a fair portion of my career analyzing and working within 
          major banks so was somewhat familiar with the regulatory and technical complexities associated with selling
          software to them. However, actually doing so would teach me a great deal on just how onerous and challenging
          this process was for all stakeholders involved.
        </p>

        <p> 
        <h4>Problem: </h4>
        <p>
          Chase, Citi and AmeEx are the top 3 largest card issuers in the United States by market share. All three place
          strong emphasis on their point card offerings, which they use to lock customers into their respective 
          financial ecosystems. Chase and Citi, which are parts of massive multinational financial service conglomerates, 
          are able to upsell customers to high value products such as home mortgages. Although most small to mid-sized 
          financial institutions issue their own debit cards, the majority don't bother with point systems due to the complexity 
          and resources involved with building such a system internally. As a result, they lose a potentially strong
          ecosystem enhancer that could better lock-in customers and make it easier to upsell higher value products
          such as home mortgage loans down the line.
        </p>
        <h4>Solution: </h4>
        <p>
          An API would enable financial institutions to add point capabilities to their existing debit card products. 
          Such a product would ingest transaction data via the Visa and Mastercard APIs and integrate with existing
          financial institution systems (on-prem or cloud-based).
        </p>

        <h4>Process: </h4>
        <p>
          I started off by speaking to numerous individuals that had worked for the credit card divisions of major banks
          in order to assess how internal systems were architected and growth strategies carried out. An interesting
          learning from these conversations was even in recent years there was little effort made to build a concerted
          strategy around actively upselling credit card customers to higher value products based on card activity. This was
          in large part due to limited collaboration between the teams that would enable this.  
        </p>
        <p>
          I worked with an engineer to map out the API and identify how it would ingest data from debit cards via Visa
          and Mastercard APIs, tag relevant transactions with points from participating retailers and interface with 
          bank systems. APIs were scoped for both banks that still maintained on-prem systems and those which had 
          migrated to cloud systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was able to get in front of decision makers within two regional banks in order to assess product-market fit 
          and determine how to best integrate an MVP with bank systems. I also reached out to startup founders that had
          successfully sold to banks in order to map out a path forward. Though these conversations went well, the subsequent 
          technical challenges of how to successfully integrate the API with bank systems became readily clear.
        </p>

        <h4>Outcome: </h4>
        <p>
          Judging from my conversations with bank software decision makers, there appeared to be a strong
          product-market fit for the API. However, given the onerous technical complexities involved with 
          integrating the API with the on-prem systems of the banks targeted for testing the MVP, I decided 
          to deprecate the project.
        </p>

        <h4>Post-Mortem: </h4>
        <p>
          If I did this project again, I would:
        </p>
        <p>
          A) Look to embed our engineering efforts with a bank partner from Day 1 to get it up and running
          as soon as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          B) Once the MVP was up and running with the first customer, I would  look to identify common 
          build components and those that needed to be customized for each customer financial institution 
          in order to develop efficient sales and integration roadmaps that could be used for subsequent 
          customers. I would also group financial institutions by internal software architectures in order to 
          better target the most promising early customers.
