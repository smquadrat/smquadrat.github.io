        <h2>SPY threshold price calculator based on U.S. Money Stock</h2>
        <h4>TL;DR</h4>
        <p>
          Built a regression model to determine how the equity market (SPY as proxy) is trading in relation to the 
          U.S. Money Stock (M2 as proxy). This can be useful for determining a threshold price for the market, above 
          which it may be overvalued and below which it may be undervalued. Input data came from the St. Louis Fed FRED 
          database (monthly M2 data) and Yahoo Finance (historical SPY data), the model was built and analyzed using 
          the sklearn library in Python while the resulting regression line was displayed using a Matplotlib chart.
        </p>

        <h4>Personal Objective: </h4>
        <p>
          I undertook this project to learn about various ways to preprocess data sets, reduce the increased risk of 
          model overfitting from smaller datasets (in this case just 767 data points for the dependent (SPY) and 
          independent (M2) variables involved) and to effectively work with cross-validation to evaluate model performance.
        </p>

        <p> 
        <h4>Problem: </h4>
        <p>
          The U.S. The Federal Reserve announced the first round of QE in November 2008 and officially began purchasing 
          a mix of mortgage-backed securities, agency debt and long-term Treasury securities in March 2009. This led to 
          a ramp up in the M2 money supply, which can be observed from monthly (formerly weekly) data provided by the 
          St. Louis Fed FRED database <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL">here</a>. A more recent spike 
          in M2 in 2020 came in part from substantial Fed stimulus to help counter the adverse economic effects of the 
          COVID-19 pandemic (in addition to <a href="https://fredblog.stlouisfed.org/2021/01/whats-behind-the-recent-surge-in-the-m1-money-supply/">Regulation D</a> 
          implementation that year). 
        <p>
        
        <p>
          Over a decade of easy monetary policy helped juice U.S. equity markets to all time highs, well out of historical 
          valuation bands. As US markets grew increasingly dependent on quantitative easing since the Great Recession, 
          Fed monetary policy became more scrutinized than ever by market participants as subsequent low rates and Fed 
          balance sheet expansion primed the economy through an expansion of U.S. money supply. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Equity markets are notoriously difficult to predict, with market participants focusing on a wide variety of 
          concrete and abstract variables in an attempt to predict market direction. Algorithmic trading systems based 
          on resulting models have become ever more complex in the pursuit of alpha. There is something to be said for a 
          simple market model that focuses on money supply to help determine if the market is currently trading above or 
          below a valuation threshold in order to inform long term investment decisions.   
        </p>
        <h4>Solution: </h4>
        <p>
          To build and analyze the model I decided to utilize Python and the popular open source sklearn machine learning 
          library due to its robust feature set, relative ease of use and because I wouldn't be working with an exceptionally 
          large dataset. Input data came from the St. Louis Fed FRED database for M2 and Yahoo Finance for SPY. The resulting 
          regression line would be displayed using a Matplotlib chart and a Python script would be used to pull updated M2 and 
          SPY data to determine if current market pricing was running above or below the threshold price determined by the 
          latest available M2 value.
        </p>

        <h4>Process: </h4>
        <p>
          I started off by putting together a scoping doc in which I outlined project objectives (determine a SPY market 
          threshold for given M2 money supply figure), risks (limited data), milestones (1. Determine variables, pull 
          and preprocess data, 2. Run regression analysis 3. Test model + assess results), assumptions (access to reliable 
          data) and constraints (delayed and increasingly limited Fed data releases).

        <p>
          1 - Prepare Data
        </p>
        <p>
          I chose SPY to represent the market (dependent variable) as it is the most widely used proxy for the U.S. 
          stock market. I chose M2 to represent money supply (independent variable) as it includes assets that are 
          highly liquid but not intended to be routinely used as cash (as opposed to M1). I pulled monthly M2 data 
          from the St. Louis Fed FRED database going back to November 1980. I pulled SPY equity data going back to 
          January 1993 from Yahoo Finance. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
          For data preprocessing I aligned the two datasets by taking monthly stock price averages for SPY to account 
          for single trading session outliers and cleaned up data points where necessary. The resulting dataset 
          encompassed 29 years from the start of 1993 to the end of 2022.
        </p>
        <p>
          2 - Regression Analysis
        </p>
        <p>
          I used the sklearn library in Python to train a linear regression model using the preprocessed data. 
          I used 75% of the dataset to train and 25% to test the model. I used standard k-fold cross-validation to 
          evaluate model performance (using common 10 folds).
        </p>
        <p>
        <p>
          3 - Model Test
        </p>
        <p>
          I tested different variations of my model and observed the resulting mean squared error and r2 
          score values. I also benchmarked against various data subsets within the 29 year main dataset and 
          tested using QQQ (Nasdaq) data as an alternate market proxy independent variable with similar results. 
          The r2 score across the various model iterations was between .85 and .93 with the final model at .92.
        </p>
        <p>
        <p>
          4 - Model Deployment
        </p>
        <p>
          I incorporated the completed model into a Python script that pulls the latest SPY price through the 
          TD Ameritrade API and compares it to the predicted SPY threshold price based on the latest monthly M2 
          value scraped from the FRED database using Selenium. 
        </p>
        <p>

        <h4>Outcome: </h4>
        <p>
          Although my hypothesis going into this project was that there would be a significant relationship 
          between money supply and equity markets (expected an r2 score of around .7), I was surprised at the 
          resulting strength based on the data I used (actual r2 score of .92). It is important to note that 
          the M2 dataset was relatively small, likely included some errors related to data collection and 
          calculation and that the Fed releases this data on a delayed schedule. However, this outcome does 
          show that money supply could potentially be one useful component of a more comprehensive market model. 
        </p>

        <h4>Post-Mortem: </h4>
        <p>
          If I did this project again, I would:
        </p>
        <p>
          A) Run the analysis again using weekly M2 data to increase the size of the dataset from 767 to over 
          3300 data points. This would help decrease the risk of overfitting.
        </p>
        <p>
          B) Add a time lag component to the analysis to observe if there is a delayed relationship between 
          M2 and SPY at various intervals (i.e. 3 months, 6 months, etc.).
        </p>
        <p>
          C) Test money supply proxy variables other than M2. For example, the Center for Financial Stability 
          (CFS) reports a more broad-based <a href="https://centerforfinancialstability.org/amfm_data.php">M4 measure</a> 
          which adds five components to M2 (including institutional money-market funds, long-term deposits, 
          repurchase agreements, commercial paper, and T-bills).
        </p>
        <p>
          D) Build a multiple linear regression model with additional independent variables other than money supply. 
          Examples could include business outlook surveys (i.e. the Manufacturing Business Outlook Survey released 
          by the Philadelphia Fed) and the Unemployment Insurance Weekly Claims Report released by the Department of 
          Labor. I would then utilize Lasso and Ridge regression models to determine how useful these additional 
          independent variables are and reduce model complexity if needed.
