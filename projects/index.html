        <h1>Projects</h1>
        <h2>Product</h2>
        <p>
          I undertook the following product-focused side projects mainly to learn about what it takes to get an impactful
          product to market. Below are descriptions of each along with a link to a more detailed outline of my
          thinking across each one with details on the problem, solution, development process, final outcome 
          and a post-mortem on what I would do differently if I repeated that project.
        </p>

        <h3><a href="bloomberg.html">Bloomberg for the masses</a></h3>
        <p>
          Built an investment insight-driven product to bridge the gap between frictionless investing apps 
          such as Robinhood and the often limited investing knowledge of their users. Utilized input from users, 
          industry veterans and A/B testing to build an MVP centered around an investment insights feed. 
          I ultimately deprecated this project due to a lack of clarity around its monetization potential.
        </p>

        <hr>
        <h3><a href="points.html">Debit card point API for financial institutions</a></h3>
        <p>
          Built an API that would give point collecting capabilities to debit cards issued by small to mid-sized
          financial institutions (i.e. credit unions and regional banks). Even though there was strong interest
          from two potential MVP candidates, the technical complexities around integrating with antiquated on-prem systems
          proved too great and I didn't pursue this project to the implementation phase.
        </p>
        <h2>Programming</h2>
        <p>
          I undertook the following programming-focused side projects to learn how to build an app in Python 
          and tinker around with some great open source libraries. I have worked with engineers in the past and had 
          the opportunity to engage in the software development process around setting requirements,
          project scoping, laying out key milestones, etc. However, building small useful apps from scratch 
          helped me move beyond project planning and simple syntax to learning about classes & objects, 
          refactoring code, integrating various libraries, Git for version control, getting a data dashboard 
          up and running online, etc.
        </p>

        <h3><a href="gamma.html">Gamma Exposure Calculator</a></h3>
        <p>
          Built a calculator that estimates the gamma exposure of market makers using ingested option chain data.
          This is useful for determining if market makers are being forced to buy or sell a certain asset in order
          to maintain neutral footing. Input data came from the TD API (instrument pricing) and the CBOE website 
          (option chains) while processed data was outputted in the form of a matplotlib chart and a csv file 
          containing underlying data.
        </p>

        <h3><a href="m2.html">Predicting SPY threshold price based on U.S. Money Stock</a></h3>
        <p>
          Built a straightforward linear regression model to predict SPY based on U.S. Money Stock data. 
          This is useful for determining a threshold price for SPY (market proxy), above which the market may be 
          overvalued and below which the market may be undervalued. Input data came from the St. Louis Fed FRED
          database (M2) and Yahoo Finance (historical SPY data), the model was built and analyzed using the 
          sklearn library in Python while the resulting regression line was displayed using a matplotlib chart.
