        <h2>Product-focused</h2>
        <p>
          I undertook the product-focused side projects below mainly to learn about what it took to get an impactful
          product to market. Below are descriptions of each along with a link to a more detailed outline of my
          thinking across each one with details on the problem, solution, the development process, final outcome 
          and a post-mortem on what I would do differently if I repeated that project.

        <h3><a href="bloomberg.html">Bloomberg for the masses</a></h3>
        <p>
          Built an investment insight-driven product to bridge the gap between frictionless investing apps 
          such as Robinhood and the often limited investing knowledge of their users. Utilized input from 
          potential users, industry veterans and A/B testing to build an MVP centered around an investment 
          insights feed. I ultimately deprecated this project due to a lack of clarity around monetization potential.

        <h3><a href="points.html">Debit cards points API for financial institutions</a></h3>
        <p>
          Built an API that would give points collecting capabilities to debit cards issued by small to mid-sized
          financial institutions (i.e. credit unions and regional banks). Even though there was strong interest
          from two potential MVP candidates, the technical complexities of integrating with antiquated on-prem systems
          proved too great and I didn't pursue the project to the implementation phase.
