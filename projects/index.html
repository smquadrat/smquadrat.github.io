        <h1>Projects</h1>
        <h2>Product</h2>
        <p>
          I undertook the following product-focused side projects mainly to learn about what it take an impactful
          product to market. Below are descriptions of each along with a link to a more detailed outline of my
          thinking across each one with details on the problem, solution, development process, final outcome 
          and a post-mortem on what I would do differently if I were to repeat the project.
        </p>

        <h3><a href="bloomberg.html">Bloomberg for the masses</a></h3>
        <p>
          Built an investment insight-driven product to bridge the gap between frictionless investing apps 
          such as Robinhood and the often limited investing knowledge of their users. Utilized input from users, 
          industry veterans and A/B testing to build a mobile app MVP centered around an investment insights feed. 
          I ultimately deprecated this project due to a lack of clarity around its monetization potential.
        </p>

        <hr>
        <h3><a href="points.html">Debit card point API for financial institutions</a></h3>
        <p>
          Built an API that would give point collecting capabilities to debit cards issued by small to mid-sized
          financial institutions (i.e. credit unions and regional banks). Even though there was strong interest
          from two potential MVP candidates, the technical complexities around integrating with antiquated on-prem systems
          proved too great and I didn't pursue this project to the implementation phase.
        </p>
        <h2>Programming</h2>
        <p>
          I undertook the following programming-focused side projects to learn how to build an app in Python 
          and tinker around with some great open source libraries including sklearn, NumPy, SciPy and Selenium. 
          I have worked with engineers on a variety of different products, which gave me the opportunity to engage 
          in the software development process around setting requirements, project scoping, laying out key milestones, 
          etc. However, building useful apps from scratch helped me move beyond project planning and simple syntax to 
          improving my experience with classes & objects, refactoring code, integrating various libraries, using Git 
          for version control, getting a data dashboard up and running online, etc.
        </p>

        <h3><a href="gamma.html">Gamma exposure calculator</a></h3>
        <p>
          Built a calculator that estimates the gamma exposure of market makers using ingested option chain data.
          This is useful in determining if market makers are being forced to buy or sell a certain asset in order
          to maintain neutral footing. Input data came from the TD Ameritrade API (instrument pricing) and the 
          Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) website (option chains) while processed data was outputted in 
          the form of a Matplotlib chart and a CSV file containing underlying data.
        </p>

        <h3><a href="m2.html">SPY threshold price calculator based on U.S. Money Stock</a></h3>
        <p>
          Built a calculator based on a regression model to determine how the equity market (SPY as proxy) is trading 
          in relation to the U.S. Money Stock (M2 as proxy). This can be useful for determining a threshold price for 
          the market, above which it may be overvalued and below which it may be undervalued. Input data came from the 
          St. Louis Fed FRED database (monthly M2 data) and Yahoo Finance (historical SPY data), the model was built 
          and analyzed using the sklearn library in Python while the resulting regression line was displayed using a 
          Matplotlib chart.
