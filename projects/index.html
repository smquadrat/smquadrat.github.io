        <h2>Product</h2>
        <p>
          I undertook the following product-focused side projects to learn about 
          what it takes to develop an impactful software product from scratch. 
          Below are project descriptions along with links to detailed outlines 
          with my thinking across the problem, solution, development process, 
          final outcome and a post-mortem for each project.
        </p>
        <h3><a href="bloomberg.html">Bloomberg for the masses</a></h3>
        <p>
          Built an investment insights product to bridge the gap between frictionless 
          investing apps such as Robinhood and the often limited investing knowledge 
          of their users.
        </p>
        <h3><a href="points.html">Debit card point API for financial institutions</a></h3>
        <p>
          Built an API that would give point collecting capabilities to debit cards 
          issued by small to mid-sized financial institutions (e.g. credit unions and 
          regional banks).

        <h2>Programming</h2>
        <p>
          I undertook the following programming-focused side projects to get experience 
          building apps from scratch to solve challenges. This helped me move beyond product 
          planning and syntax to working with classes & objects, refactoring code for speed 
          and efficiency, integrating various libraries, using Git for version control, 
          getting data dashboards up and running online, etc. The projects below are broken up 
          into detailed study projects with write-ups and velocity-driven projects with GitHub 
          and web service links where available (note that they may take a few moments to spool up).
        </p>

        <h3>Detailed Study Projects</h3>
        <h3><a href="gamma.html">Gamma exposure calculator</a></h3>
        <p>
          Built a calculator that estimates the gamma exposure of market makers using ingested 
          option chain data. This can be useful for determining if market makers are being 
          forced to buy or sell a certain asset in order to maintain neutral footing.
        </p>
        <h3><a href="m2.html">SPY threshold price calculator based on U.S. Money Stock</a></h3>
        <p>
          Built a calculator based on a regression model to determine how the equity market 
          is trading in relation to the U.S. Money Stock. This can be useful for determining 
          a threshold price for the market, above which it may be overvalued and below which 
          it may be undervalued.
