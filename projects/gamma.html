        <h2>Gamma Exposure Calculator</h2>
        <h4>TL;DR</h4>
        <p>
          Built a calculator that estimates the gamma exposure of market makers using ingested option chain data.
          This is useful in determining if market makers are being forced to buy or sell a certain asset in order
          to maintain neutral footing. Input data came from the TD API (instrument pricing) and the CBOE website 
          (option chains) while processed data was outputted in the form of a matplotlib chart and a csv file
          containing underlying data.

        <h4>Personal Objective: </h4>
        <p>
          I undertook this project to learn about what it takes to build a useful app from scratch as it solved an 
          actual problem I had in determining how market makers are positioned for a given security (i.e. S&P 500). 
          Although my initial objective was to simply output a gamma exposure (GEX) figure, over time I added
          additional capabilities and features.
        </p>

        <p> 
        <h4>Problem: </h4>
        <p>
          Gamma exposure calculations exist in somewhat of an esoteric realm given how few traders and investors
          would know about or, much less, utilize them. As a result they are not (to my knowledge) included as a
          part of any of the major brokerage platforms (i.e. Interactive Brokers, Thinkorswim, etc.) Part of this
          may also be due to how data intensive these calculations can be; an option chain for popular high volume 
          securities can involve thousands of data points.
        </p>
        <h4>Solution: </h4>
        <p>
          I decided to utilize Python due to its great out-of-the-box data science capabilities and numerous useful 
          built-in libraries. Input data came from the TD API (instrument pricing in json format) and the CBOE website 
          (option chains in csv format) while processed data was outputted in the form of a matplotlib chart and a 
          csv file containing underlying data.
        </p>

        <h4>Process: </h4>
        <p>
          I started off by putting together a scoping doc in which I outlined project objectives (output GEX figure for
          given instrument), risks (poor/eroneous data, scope creep), milestones (1 - Pull data, 2 - Calculation 3 - 
          Output to chart/csv), assumptions (access to reliable data) and constraints (free data). 

        <p>
          1 - Pull Data
        </p>
        <p>
          I needed to get a hold of live market data along with corresponding option chains. As I didn't want to use 
          paid data (which can be absurdly expensive) I tested Yahoo Finance, Interactive Brokers and TD Ameritrade data
          APIs. After numerous API reliability issues with the former two, I found the TD API to be vastly superior and 
          linked to it. However, when it came to options data, I found it to have throttling issues when pulling entire 
          option chains so utilized CBOE excel data instead. The CBOE website is notoriously strict about bulk data
          pulls so I ran Selenium with a headless Chrome webdriver in order to automate the manual downloading of csv
          files containing option chain data for each instrument.
        </p>
        <p>
          2 - Calculation
        </p>
        <p>
          As the CBOE option chain data was formatted in a particular way it needed a considerable amount of preprocessing,
          which I achieved with Pandas dataframes to locate and strip certain dates, times and numbers. I extracted bid,
          ask, last sale, implied volatility, delta, gamma, open interest and strike data and placed it into a new
          dataframe. From there I was able to calculate updated option greeks and ultimately GEX itself with the help of
          the py_vollib library. 
        </p>
        <p>
        <p>
          3 - Output
        </p>
        <p>
          I initially outputted corresponding GEX values using a simple print statement to the IDE terminal but later 
          added a simple matplotlib graphic along with output csv files in an output directory. Given how time-consuming 
          the calculation process could be, it was important to make it easy to reference outputs that didn't need to be 
          constantly recalculated.
        </p>
        <p>

        <h4>Outcome: </h4>
        <p>
          The final result exceeded my expectations and delivered on my original objective of outputting a gamma 
          exposure figure for any given publically traded instrument that also trades as options. I added loops 
          for pulling the latest price and option chain for securities contained in a feeder file, output csv 
          files stored in their own directory and even a Streamlit dashboard to display daily outputs from 
          processed data in a browser.
        </p>
        <p>
          Speed remained a factor, which I improved upon by breaking the program into seperate components, 
          some code refactoring and careful data pull throttling on my side to maximize pull speed from the TD API 
          and Selenium for option chains on the CBOE site. 
          
          More substantial improvements would likely require the employment of professional data feeds.
        </p>

        <h4>Post-Mortem: </h4>
        <p>
          If I did this project again, I would:
        </p>
        <p>
          A) Focus on data providers with the most reliable data APIs at the start
        </p>
        <p>
          B) Initially scope the program to be multiple components to cut down on complexity and calculation times
        </p>
