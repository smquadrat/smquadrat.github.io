      <h1>Hi, I'm Sebastian!</h1>
      <p>
        I'm a San Francisco-based technologist who loves to build impactful 
        products. I have a particular affinity for SaaS and FinTech. 
      </p>

      <p>
        My work experience spans product, strategy and finance. I've worked 
        across company stages, from a 5 person startup to pre-IPO Dropbox 
        and major investment banks. I spent the first few years of my career
        in Tokyo with shorter stints in Hong Kong, Sydney and New York City 
        before settling in the Bay Area.

      <p>
        Some of the product-focused side projects that I have undertaken can be found <a href="projects/index.html">here</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        I love to tinker around with code, utilizing open source libraries where 
        applicable, to build small useful programs. The majority of these have 
        centered around ingesting raw market options and futures data and 
        outputting potentially actionable insights to a dashboard or output file.
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside of tech, I enjoy films (ala Kurosawa, Tarkovsky and Kubrick),
        books (particularly science fiction ala William Gibson, Neal Stephenson 
        and Arthur C. Clarke), travel, motorcycles, strategy games and photography.
