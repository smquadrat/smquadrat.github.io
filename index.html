      <h1>Hi, I'm Sebastian!</h1>
      <p>
        I'm a San Francisco-based technologist who loves to build impactful 
        products, particularly in SaaS and fintech.
      </p>

      <p>
        With professional experience spanning product, strategy and finance, 
        I've worked across company stages, from a 5 person startup to pre-IPO 
        Dropbox and global investment banks. I began my career in Tokyo with 
        stints in Hong Kong, Sydney and New York City before settling in the 
        Bay Area.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have taken on exciting early product work for projects that turned 
        into valuable learning endeavors. I also love to tinker with code, 
        with a bias toward velocity, to build practical programs. Some of the 
        product and programming-focused side projects that I have undertaken 
        can be found <a href="projects/index.html">here</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Aside from tech, I enjoy films (e.g. Kurosawa, Tarkovsky and Kubrick),
        books (particularly science fiction e.g. William Gibson, Neal Stephenson 
        and Arthur C. Clarke), travel, motorcycles, strategy games, history and photography.
      </p>
