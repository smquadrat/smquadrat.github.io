      <h1>Hi, I'm Sebastian!</h1>
      <p>
        I'm a San Francisco-based technologist who loves to build impactful 
        products. I have a particular affinity for SaaS and FinTech. 
      </p>

      <p>
        My work experience spans product, strategy and finance. I've worked 
        across company stages, from a 5 person startup to pre-IPO Dropbox 
        and major investment banks. I spent the first few years of my career
        in Tokyo with shorter stints in Hong Kong, Sydney and New York City 
        before settling in the Bay Area.
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside of tech, I enjoy films (ala Kurosawa, Tarkovsky and Kubrick),
        books (particularly science fiction), travel, puzzles and photography.
      </p>
